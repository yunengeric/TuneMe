TuneMe is an online media management site which allows users to buy and download media files eg movies/songs. The tasks are described below; in each task description, the success or normal case is described first, then any special or error cases.

1.	Register Member
	A member has a unique integer id, a name, a balance, a password and a library (list of media). The id is generated by the system when the member is added to the site; the first id is 1, the second is 2, and so on. The system confirms a new record has been created. 

2.	Add Media
	Media can either be a Song or Movie. Media has a unique integer id, a name and purchase price. If the media is a song it has an artist and album name. If the media is a movie it has a release year and list of main actors. The id is generated by the system when the media is added to the site; the first id is 1, the second is 2, and so on. The system confirms a new record has been created. 

3.	Browse Media
	A user can browse all media available on TuneMe, the report displays each id, title and purchase price and the media type song or movie).

4.	Login
User types the member id and password, the system verifies the password and allows the member to access buy and report features for the client.

5.	Buy Media – must be logged in
The media id is entered; the system finds the correct media. The media is added to the member’s library and the member is charged the purchase price. If the member already has the media in their library, the system displays an error and the action is terminated.


6.	Display Member Report – must be logged in

8.	Display Site Report
Displays all media available on TuneMe, all members including their balance and the turnover for TuneMe.

4.	Code Structure

1.	Skeleton code
This skeleton code must be used; a task that does not use the skeleton code provided for that task gets a mark of zero. You may add other classes.

2.	List classes
You must store the objects in linked lists; arrays, vectors, or any other type of collection cannot be used to store an object. There are three group classes that contain a list of objects and the code to add, find, and remove objects etc from that list.

3.	Scanner
There are issues using the Scanner method nextLine() in combination with nextInt() and nextDouble() – you may have seen this is IPRG001. To overcome this issue, please use the In class described in the lecture notes.

4.	Menu
	The system menu has 10 choices:
	R – Register Member
	A – Add Media
	B – Browse Media
	L – Login
	Y – Buy Media
	M – Member report
	O – Logout
	S – Site Report
	? – Help
	X - Exit

A run of you system should display the following:
* all normal cases – register member, add media, browse media, login, buy media, Member Report, logout, Site report, help gives a brief summary of each option, exit with confirmation
* all error cases – login failure – password incorrect/no member, buy media failure – not enough money/already owned/no media found, incorrect action, exit not confirmed.
